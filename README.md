askRabbit is a mini web application that allows users to manage tasks, register, authenticate, upload images, and manage their profiles. This project demonstrates the implementation of user registration and authentication, image uploads, user profiles, and task management.

Features
1. User Registration and Authentication
User Registration: Users can register with an email, username, and password.
Authentication: Users can log in and out, with password hashing and session management.
Score: Score 3 for registration and authentication. Basic client-side validations are implemented, and server-side validation ensures data integrity. For higher scoring, additional features like multi-factor authentication and JWTs could be added.
2. Image Uploads and Storage
Image Upload: Users can upload images, but no file type or size validation is currently in place.
Score: Score 2. Basic image upload functionality is present. To achieve a higher score, implement file size/type validation, secure storage, and image optimization.
3. User Profiles
Profile Page: Users have a static profile page with no update functionality.
Score: Score 1. The profile page does not yet support updates or advanced features. For a higher score, add functionality for updating user profiles, real-time feedback, and secure file uploads.
4. Task Management
Task Management: Users can create and list tasks.
Score: Score 2. Basic task creation and listing are implemented. Enhancements like updating, deleting tasks, and advanced UI features can improve the score.
